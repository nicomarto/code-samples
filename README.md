# Code Samples

In this page you may find code samples revealing my skills in Python, R and Stata 

**Python Sample**: Here you will have an idea of my skills using NumPy, Matplotlib and seaborn. On the file "Monte Carlo Simulation" you will find a traditional data generating process, its plots and a Ordinary Least Square regression. 

On "SIR simulation model" file, you can kindly find a simple simulation model of a pandemic evolution, and how it changes with the introduction of a vaccine of 60% efficacy rate in the prevention of symptomatic cases.

On "Model Selection Criteria", you may kindly have a taste of my skills using Pandas and Econtools.metrics, in a little play with the different Criteria used for Model Selection. Unfortunately, the Database is subject to copyright it is no possible to upload it to this repository.

On "Decision Tree and Bagging Classifier application in Finance", you could inspect a basic application of Decission Trees and Bagging Classifiers for financial applications

**R Sample**: Here, you may kindly find simple financial returns models by using quantmod, fBasics, kableExtra and fUnitRoots.

**MATLAB Sample**: Here, you will kindly have a glimpse of my skills in MATLAB. The Folder contains a main M file, which computes the General Equilibrium in a Economy that allocates job occupations, years of education and salaries to the population. This model was constructed to simulate how the share of workers in each job occupations is sustained by their years of eduaction necessary for the job occupation and their salary in each occupaiton in equilibrium. Also, you may kindly find all the functions that are called in the main M file to compute production of years of education, the economy's production, fixed point, among other things.

**STATA**
