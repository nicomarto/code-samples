# Code Samples

In this page you may find code samples revealing my skills in Python, R and Stata 

**Python Sample**: Here you will have an idea of my skills using NumPy, Matplotlib and seaborn. On the file "Monte Carlo Simulation" you will find a traditional data generating process, its plots and a Ordinary Least Square regression. 

On "SIR simulation model" file, you can kindly find a simple simulation model of a pandemic evolution, and how it changes with the introduction of a vaccine of 60% efficacy rate in the prevention of symptomatic cases.
